					<h2 id="websitevisitors">1. Website Visitors</h2>
					<p>
						Like most website operators, CropCartel collects
						non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers
						and servers typically make available, such as the browser type,
						language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each
						visitor request. CropCartel&apos;s purpose in collecting non-personally
						identifying information is to better understand how CropCartel&apos;s
						visitors use its website. From time to time, CropCartel may release
						non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by
						publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
					</p>
					<p>
						CropCartel also collects potentially personally-identifying
						information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged-in users
						and for users leaving comments on [Website URL] blog posts. CropCartel
						only discloses logged-in user and commenter IP addresses under the
						same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
						information as described below.
					</p>

					<h2 id="PII">2. Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
					<p>
						Certain visitors to CropCartel&apos;s websites choose to interact with
						CropCartel in ways that require CropCartel to gather
						personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information
						that CropCartel gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For
						example, we ask visitors who leave a comment at [Website URL] to
						provide a username and email address.
					</p>

					<h2 id="Security">3. Security</h2>
					<p>
						The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but
						remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method

						commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we
						cannot guarantee its absolute security.

						Ads appearing on our website may be delivered to users by advertising
						partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to

						to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This
						information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted
						advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This
						Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by CropCartel Website and
						does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.

						privacy policies, or practices of any third party sites, products, or
						services.

					<h2 id="Remarketing">6. CropCartel uses Google AdWords for remarketing</h2>
					<p>
						CropCartel uses the remarketing services to advertise on third party
						websites (including Google) to previous visitors to our site. It could
						mean that we advertise to previous visitors who haven&apos;t completed a
						task on our site, for example using the contact form to make an
						enquiry. This could be in the form of an advertisement on the Google
						search results page, or a site in the Google Display Network.
						Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based
						on someone&apos;s past visits. Of course, any data collected will be used
						in accordance with our own privacy policy and Google&apos;s privacy policy.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can set preferences for how Google advertises to you using the
						Google Ad Preferences page, and if you want to you can opt out of
						interest-based advertising entirely by cookie settings or permanently
						using a browser plugin.
					</p>

					<h2 id="Stats">7. Aggregated Statistics</h2>
					<p>
						CropCartel may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its
						website. CropCartel may display this information publicly or provide it
						to others. However, CropCartel does not disclose your
						personally-identifying information.

					<p>
						To enrich and perfect your online experience, CropCartel uses &quot;Cookies&quot;,
						similar technologies and services provided by others to display
						personalized content, appropriate advertising, and store your

						A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a
						visitor&apos;s computer, and that the visitor&apos;s browser provides to the
						website each time the visitor returns. CropCartel uses cookies to help
						CropCartel identify and track visitors, their usage of [Website URL],
						and their website access preferences. CropCartel Website visitors who
						do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their
						browsers to refuse cookies before using CropCartel&apos;s websites, with
						the drawback that certain features of CropCartel&apos;s websites may not
						function properly without the aid of cookies.

						settings, you hereby acknowledge and agree to CropCartel&apos;s use of
